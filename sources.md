# openembedded-core

https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/log/?h=langdale

Seems to be a fork of yocto-4.1.1 with a few csky patches:

```
git clone -b yocto-4.1.1 https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
```

# openembedded-core/bitbake/

https://git.openembedded.org/bitbake/log/?h=2.2

```
git clone -b yocto-4.1 https://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
```

# meta-openembedded

Seems to be an early commit from the langdale branch:

```
git clone -b langdale https://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
```
